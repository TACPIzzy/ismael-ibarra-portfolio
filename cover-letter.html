    <p><strong>Hiring Manager</strong></p>

    <p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>

    <p>I am writing to express my interest in opportunities within cloud networking, secure communications, wireless security, and site reliability engineering. With 24 years of experience in tactical communications, multi‑domain network operations, and systems engineering—supported by an active TS/SCI clearance and prior SAP responsibilities—I bring a mission‑focused mindset and a strong technical foundation in secure, resilient infrastructure.</p>

    <p>In my current role as a Senior Specialist in Systems Engineering at L3Harris Technologies, I troubleshoot and integrate complex airborne and ground‑based communication systems, including datalinks, SATCOM, and secure IP‑based architectures. I routinely diagnose RF/IP interoperability issues, validate system behavior across multi‑node environments, and ensure TEMPEST‑compliant configurations during lab and field testing. This work has strengthened my ability to analyze, secure, and optimize networks that operate in demanding and high‑stakes environments.</p>

    <p>Previously, during my internship with Northrop Grumman, I supported system hardening efforts across large‑scale simulation environments, contributing to improved stability, reduced vulnerabilities, and more efficient engineering workflows. My military career as a Tactical Air Control Party (TACP) operator further shaped my ability to manage secure tactical networks, coordinate joint communications, and operate effectively under pressure while maintaining strict security and compliance standards.</p>

    <p>I am currently completing a B.S. in Cloud and Network Engineering at Western Governors University, expanding my expertise in cloud architecture, network security, automation fundamentals, and systems reliability. I am committed to continuous learning and consistently apply new knowledge to improve the performance, security, and scalability of the systems I support.</p>

    <p>I am excited about the opportunity to contribute to a team that values secure design, operational excellence, and innovative problem‑solving. I bring a blend of hands‑on engineering experience, disciplined execution, and clear technical communication that I believe would be an asset to any organization focused on building and protecting modern infrastructure.</p>

    <p>Thank you for your time and consideration. I welcome the opportunity to discuss how my background and technical skill set can support your team’s mission and long‑term goals.</p>
